title: Shoebox Collaboration - New Start
date: 2017-03-30

Hi all, I created this new repo with documentation section today. I hope, it will be useful for our collaboration. I set up the github pages as a jekyll rendered documentation. So you can simply add pages and they will show up in the docs. I suggest, if you would like to add your own topis, do it as a POST, all of them will be listed on the main page, automatically.

A couple of hints:

## add post

Just create a file in the gh-pages branch of the repo, with the format of "YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md" and fill it with markdown text. That's it!

## add page

Simply add a file in main directory of gh-pages branch with markdown extension (bla.md), will work.
