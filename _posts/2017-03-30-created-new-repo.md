New

Hi all, I created this new repo with documentation section today. I hope, it will be useful for our collaboration. A couple of hints:

## add post

Just create a file in the gh-pages branch of the repo, with the format of <YEAR>-<MONTH>-<DAY>-title.md and fill it with markdown text. That's it!

## add page

Simply add a file in main directory of gh-pages branch with markdown extension (bla.md), will work.
